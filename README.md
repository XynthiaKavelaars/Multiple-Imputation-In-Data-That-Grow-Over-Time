Make sure the working directory is set to folder "Simulation 1 20% missing values" or "Simulation 2 50% missing values" when running scripts from the "Simulation - Linear regression" 
folder. Make sure the working directory is set to folder "Simulation - Growth model" when running scripts from the "Simulation - Growth model" 
folder. The working directory must be set to folder "Application" when running scripts from the
"Application" folder.
